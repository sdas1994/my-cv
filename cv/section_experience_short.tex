                      \begin{itemize}
                        \item Designed a system of gRPC microservices in Python, responsible for device fingerprinting 
                        \item Asynchronous integration with third party APIs, using multithreading, to maximize performance
                        \item Designed a novel schema to populate local signatures, based on regexes and Jinja templates
                        \item Dockerized the build process, used Terraform to programatically control deployment of container on AWS
                        \item Highly scalable, handles a million concurrent requests with consistent 99.99th percentile latency
                        \item Built metrics pipeline and dashboard on Prometheus and Grafana, and ran analytics on activity data
                        \item Led a team of two to develop data pipelines on GPDB, orchestrated by Apache Airflow using Scala
                        \item Supervised building of a database of devices with auxilliary information. Created an endpoint to match string query to closest matching database entry using string similarity and semantic embedding
                      \end{itemize}
